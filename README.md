# InterVLAN-Routing-Lab
This project demonstrates Inter-VLAN Routing using the Router-on-a-Stick method in Cisco Packet Tracer. A central router (CORP) is configured with subinterfaces to provide routing between VLANs, while Layer 2 switches handle VLAN segmentation. An ISP router is also connected via a serial WAN link to simulate external connectivity.
